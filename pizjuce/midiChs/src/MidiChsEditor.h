    This is the Component that our filter will use as its UI.

    One or more of these is created by the MidiChsProcessor::createEditor() method,
    and they will be deleted at some later time by the wrapper code.

    To demonstrate the correct way of connecting a filter to its UI, this
    class is a ChangeListener, and our demo filter is a ChangeBroadcaster. The
    editor component registers with the filter when it's created and deregisters
    when it's destroyed. When the filter's parameters are changed, it broadcasts
    a message and this editor responds by updating its display.
